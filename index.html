        <p>About me</p>
        <p>
          It is really hard to describe oneself out in plain words. There is not
          one thing, that I can exactly say about myself. I don't know who I am.
          Even though I am the one who should knows myself the best, yet I am
          here, thinking what I would say about myself. So let's be
          superficial.<br />
          My name is Justyna- I'm 23 years old who wants to find purpose in
          life. Or I already found it! Who knows ... <br />
          I'm currently combining studies and work. I will graduate in civil
          engineering only next year, because at the moment I took academic
          holidays. Also I'm working as a junior engineering at
          <i>"INHUS Engineering"</i> construction company. <br />
          But,to be honest, I am not satified with the chosen direction. That's
          why I'm trying to change my specialty by taking additional courses
          like CodeAcedemy for beginners.

          I think I have couple of hobbies, so I want to write more about them
          below.

            I read my first book when I was 8 years old. It was Harry Potter and
            Philosopher's Stone. And from then my journey began.I won't be able
            to tell how many books I've read now, but if I'm intersted in a book
            then I could finish it in 3 days.

            Photography allows us to capture the most beautiful moments of our
            lives. Moments which we cannot ever return to, but we can capture
            them up in the form of photos. Photographs are free passes to our
            past!
